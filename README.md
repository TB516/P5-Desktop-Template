# P5.js Desktop template

Template repo for p5.js desktop development. Create p5.js art scripts without needing any html or css! Once your art is done, bundle it down with the build command to get your minified js file, then distribute it however you'd like!

## VSCode profile quickstart

If you want to dive right into developing, [here is a vscode profile to copy](https://vscode.dev/profile/github/6431b1d5dbeb3985837424ef0b36d639). It contains tools for p5 development such as spellcheck, a live canvas and shortcut for it, prettier, and more.

2. Create project folder in the src directory
3. Create sketch.js file in directory
